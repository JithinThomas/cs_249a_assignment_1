Building and running
======================

* Compiling the application code
	* cd <ROOT>/src/malwaresim
	* make
	* The executable 'malwaresim' would be generated in the same folder, ie, src/malwaresim

* Compiling and running the test suite
	* NOTE: The Makefile assumes that the gtest framework is present in <ROOT>/gtest-1.7.0
	* cd <ROOT>/tests/malwaresim
	* make
	* ./unittests

Architecture of the application
================================

Classes
========

* MalwareSim
	* The MalwareSim::evalStream() method reads the input script line by line
	* It parses each command and maps it one of the 9 command types (eg: networkNew, personalNew, etc.)
		* Note that it ignores commands which are comments or are invalid due to extraneous args, etc.
	* The MalwareSim class maintains an instance of the System class (described below)
	* Once the type of the command is determined, it calls the appropriate method of the System object to make progress in the simulation

* System
	* This class encapsulates the core logic of the application.
    * It maintains the entire state of a simulation such as the list of networks, etc.
    * It exposes a public method corresponding to each of the 9 types of commands.
		* Each command's return value indicates whether the command was run successfully or not
		* If a command is skipped, a warning is printed to stderr

* NetworkTracker
	* Subclass of Network::Notifiee
	* Overrides onDeviceNew() and onDeviceDel()
	* Within onDeviceNew(), it creates a DeviceTracker instance for the newly created device and adds it to the device's notifiees

* DeviceTracker
	* Subclass of Device::Notifiee
	* Overrides onHealth()

Collaboration
==============

* Collaborated with Jayesh Y and Fuad Al-Amin regarding the testing of the code.
* Shared test scripts and compared the outputs to ensure they match.
* Jayesh pointed out a bug in my output for one of the scripts.
